# Pivoting: Questions to think about

- [ ] What types of artifacts and data sources can we use for pivoting? What artifacts do you see most analysts use? What are the pros and cons of each type of artifact/data source? Can you think of data sources that could be useful for pivoting that weren’t mentioned in the above resources?
- [ ] How do we know if pivots are meaningful or not? What level of specificity or uniqueness makes for a meaningful pivot?
- [ ] What is the point of pivoting? What do analysts gain from it?
- [ ] What are potential consequences of making analytic conclusions based solely on pivots?
- [ ] What happens as you continue pivoting off of newly-found information? How does each “hop” from your initial data point affect the relationship of the newly-found information? What are the risks and limitations of pivoting?
