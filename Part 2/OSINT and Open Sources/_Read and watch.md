# OSINT and Open Sources: Read and watch

- [ ] Read selections from this Army publication on OSINT: [https://irp.fas.org/doddir/army/atp2-22-9.pdf](https://irp.fas.org/doddir/army/atp2-22-9.pdf) 
    - From Katie: "you can skim the whole thing, but I recommend reading just pages 21–23 (starting at Open-Source Reliability heading), page 41 (Information Reliability and Credibility heading), and page 43 (section 4–13) (hat tip to Casey Brooks for this reference)"
- [ ] Read [Sergio Caltagirone’s blog post](https://www.threatintel.academy/intelligence-or-marketing/) about how to differentiate reports from vendors as threat intelligence or marketing using the ADEPT model.
- [ ] Skim [this DNI page](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/what-we-do/what-is-intelligence), focusing on the OSINT definition and the other 5 “INTs”.
- [ ] Watch this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IETRHdMejaw) from Sherman Chu on Current Intelligence.
- [ ] Skim this page that lists many available open sources: https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence. Think about the major categories of sources and where you think this data comes from.
