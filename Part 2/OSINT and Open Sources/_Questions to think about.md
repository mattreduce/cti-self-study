- [ ] Based on the DNI webpage, how does the U.S. government think about OSINT? How does that differ from how the private sector should think about and practice OSINT?
- [ ] What are the risks and drawbacks of using open sources in cyber threat intelligence analysis? How can you mitigate those in order to use open sources in an appropriate way?
- [ ] Who produces what is available in different open sources (for example, the sources listed in Awesome Threat Intelligence)? What limitations does that result in?
- [ ] What CTI requirements (see part 1 for more on requirements) do you think can be fulfilled with open sources? How do you think open sources can be best used to produce CTI?
