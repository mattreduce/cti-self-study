# OSINT and Open Sources: Things to do

- [ ] From Katie: "If you haven’t already, create a Twitter account and follow some CTI people (if you follow @likethecoins, Twitter will automagically start recommending other accounts to follow). I also recommend creating your own RSS feed as recommended in [part 1](https://medium.com/katies-five-cents/a-cyber-threat-intelligence-self-study-plan-part-1-968b5a8daf9a), but if you don’t want to, here is [a starter RSS feed (downloads an .OPML file hosted on my Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/181y0UlW3DAiQ2KQ1WKFEMgoaqqPPrFIF/view?usp=sharing) that you can import into any RSS feed tool of your choice. (Feedly is a good starting point!) Please note this is a recommended starting point, and I’m certain I forgot some excellent blogs, so I appreciate your understanding if yours isn’t included."
- [ ] Find a blog post or report from a cybersecurity vendor via your Twitter or RSS feed. Apply Sergio’s ADEPT model and make your own assessment on whether it falls more under intelligence and marketing.
- [ ] Find a different blog post or report and evaluate its reliability and credibility based on section 4–13 of the Army PDF above — Identity, Authority, Motive, Access, Timeliness, Internal and External Consistency (note that you will likely apply the Internal and External Consistency criteria differently than the Army publication. Think of internal consistency as whether the piece contradicts itself. Think of external consistency as whether the piece has contradictory information to other external sources.).
- [ ] Find a Twitter account and apply the same criteria above to an account and tweet
    - [ ] Identity
    - [ ] Authority
    - [ ] Motive
    - [ ] Access
    - [ ] Timeliness
    - [ ] Internal and external consistency
