# Clustering, Creating, and Naming Groups: Questions to think about

- [ ] Do you think Rosetta Stones are useful? (A [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) is a resource that “translates” different group names, for example, [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H9_xaxQHpWaa4O_Son4Gx0YOIzlcBWMsdvePFX68EKU/edit#gid=1864660085).)
    - [ ] What are the limitations of Rosetta Stones for tracking group names?
- [ ] Do you think the CTI community can agree on a consistent names and definition for groups?
    - [ ] Why or why not?
    - [ ] How could this happen if analysts wanted to try?
- [ ] What are the risks of using a group name that another team created? (Here’s [an example](https://twitter.com/wesdrone/status/1542513910221131780))
    - [ ] Do you think that risk is worth it to not add another group name (and potentially more confusion)?
- [ ] What are some common attributes/observables/data points that analysts use when identifying overlaps to create groups? (The Spooky RYUK-y webinar is a great place to look for this.)
    - [ ] Which of these attributes do you think are most and least useful for identifying meaningful overlaps? (for example, if you saw PowerShell used in two different incidents, would you create a group based solely on that technique use?)
- [ ] What do you like and not like about methodologies used by different teams to cluster?
    - [ ] What are the benefits and drawbacks of using an uncategorized clustering methodology for initial analysis? (e.g. [UNC > APT or FIN](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/how-mandiant-tracks-uncategorized-threat-actors))
