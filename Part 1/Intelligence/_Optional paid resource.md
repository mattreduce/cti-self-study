# Intelligence: Optional paid resource

- [ ] If you’re looking to learn more about the US Intelligence Community, I recommend Mark Lowenthal’s “Intelligence: From Secrets to Policy”. Older editions are almost as good and are much cheaper. This is the book I was assigned in my intelligence class in grad school and it’s widely used in higher education.
