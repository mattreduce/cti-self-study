# Intelligence: Things to do

- [ ] Go research Sherman Kent and Richards Heuer — why were they considered important in this field (especially in Western intelligence)? Who are other figures that are important in intelligence, especially from a _non_-Western perspective? (go research and find at least one)
- [ ] Scroll around [this cognitive biases site](https://yourbias.is/) and go research cognitive biases to find a few that weren’t in Heuer’s book.
- [ ] Identify your own cognitive biases in everyday life. This is HARD, but you can do it if you’re honest with yourself. Tip: anything that makes you angry is a great place to look for biases. Write down your cognitive biases when you find them.
