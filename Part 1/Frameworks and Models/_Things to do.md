# Frameworks and Models: Things to do

- [ ] Take the [ATT&CK for CTI training](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/training/cti/) I created with my former teammate Adam Pennington, designed to take about four hours. (Note that it’s based on a previous version of ATT&CK, but you’ll still get the key points.)
- [ ] Find at least one example of a team (perhaps a cybersecurity vendor) applying each of the frameworks or models you learned about above. Think about your opinion of the pros and cons of how they applied it.
- [ ] Go look for examples of combining two or more of these frameworks. (Hint: Palo Alto’s Unit 42 team has a good one, though there are others!)
