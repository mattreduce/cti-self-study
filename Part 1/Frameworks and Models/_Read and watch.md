# Frameworks and Models: Read and watch

- [ ] Read Chris Sanders’ [blog on mental models](https://chrissanders.org/2019/05/infosec-mental-models/).
- [ ] Read the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain(R) [paper](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf).
- [ ] If you’re a Star Wars fan, read this [ThreatConnect blog](https://threatconnect.com/blog/diamond-model-threat-intelligence-star-wars/) on applying Star Wars to the Diamond Model. (If you’re not a fan, you can obviously still read it, it just might not make as much sense to you!)
- [ ] Read the [Diamond Model paper](https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf). It’s dense, but it’s awesome, so break it up into parts if you need to.
- [ ] Click around the [VERIS website](http://veriscommunity.net/) and skim various sections — maybe the “Quick Start” section or whatever section helps you learn what VERIS is and why you might use it.
