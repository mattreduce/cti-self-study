# The CTI Community: Things to do

- [ ] Create a Twitter account (it doesn’t have to be in your real name) and go find people to find in CTI to follow. If you’re not sure who to follow, check out me (@likethecoins) and see who I re-tweet and interact with, or follow some people I mention in this post. From your Twitter research, figure out what hash tags the CTI community uses. Follow these hash tags — you might find it easier to use [TweetDeck](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-use-tweetdeck) to do this.
- [ ] Create an RSS feed of some resources you see those Twitter accounts share. You could use Feedly’s free offerings to do this, or many [other free RSS feed options](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/). Building a good RSS feed is essential for many CTI roles, as it will allow you to stay up to date with new blog posts and reports. Remember that your RSS feed will grow and change over time based on new sources you find and your needs (requirements!!!), so don’t worry about getting it “perfect” to start.
