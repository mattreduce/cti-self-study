# The CTI Community: Questions to think about

- [ ] What people and companies make up the “CTI community”? (For example, vendors are one group— what are others?) How does the “CTI community” overlap with other parts of the cybersecurity community like DFIR?
- [ ] What roles do CTI analysts and CTI companies play in the community? What are their backgrounds and what do they do? Do they have a specific angle or agenda? What role does media play in the CTI community?
- [ ] What are analysts discussing about CTI on Twitter? Who seems to represent what perspectives? What in their background might lead them to have those perspectives?
- [ ] What are key events and conferences that happen in the CTI community? Which are free and how much do they cost? What approach/angle do different events take?
